Summary: Hello!

Hello! My name is Brian Estevez. I was born in New York City, and raised in a neighborhood called Ridgewood that is located on the border of Queens and Brooklyn. 
My background is not in computer science nor in programming. I came onto these things later in life as I got a better handle on what inspires me and how to express myself creatively.

Enter what may as well be a **magical paint brush** called the Python programming language. The Python programming language is a very popular and human understandable computer programming language. Based on its vast applications in artificial intelligence, finance, robotics, data analysis and its use by those in priate commerical and academic sectors, it seems there are unlimited possibilities to what you can do with it.  

I've been particularly fascinated by the applications of Python to data analysis, geographic information systems, drones, and severe weather, specifically tornadoes. 

My goal is to deepen my own understanding of these fields and inspire others to do the same.
