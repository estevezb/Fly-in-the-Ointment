Summary: Hello!

Hello! My name is Brian Estevez. I am originally from New York City, raised in a neighborhood called Ridgewood that is on the border of Queens and Brooklyn. 
Now I reside in suburban Minnesota. My background is not in computer science nor in programming. I came onto Python later in life after spending many years in biomedical research. ðŸ”¬

I really enjoy learning and writing Python, and this website aims to be a testament to this fact. I am particularly fascinated in the application of Python with regard to data analysis, geographic information systems, drones, and severe weather, specifically tornadoes.

My goal is to deepen my own understanding in these fields and inspire others to do the same.
