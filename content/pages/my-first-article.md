Summary: Hello!

Hello! My name is Brian Estevez. I was born in New York City, and raised in a neighborhood called Ridgewood that is located on the border of Queens and Brooklyn.

My background is not in computer science nor in programming. I discovered these interests later in life, when I found Python Programming was a creative outlet that brings me joy.

The Python programming language is a very popular and human understandable computer programming language. It has broad applications in artificial intelligence, computer vision, data analysis and data visualization, to name a few.  

I view the Python programming language as a *magical paint brush* ðŸŽ¨ðŸ–Œ. This site is a place to share works where I experiment with and discuss digital creations made with Python, focusing on data analysis, geographic information systems, drones, and severe weather, specifically tornadoes.
