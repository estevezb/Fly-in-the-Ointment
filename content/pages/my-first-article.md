Summary: Hello!

Hello! My name is Brian Estevez. I was born in New York City, and raised in a neighborhood called Ridgewood that is located on the border of Queens and Brooklyn. 
My background is not in computer science nor in programming. I discovered these interests later in life, when I found a creative outlet whose gurus inspire me and whose practice brings me joy.

Enter what might as well be a *magical paint brush* ðŸŽ¨ðŸ–Œ called the Python programming language. The Python programming language is a very popular and human understandable computer programming language. It has broad applications in artificial intelligence, computer vision, data analysis and data visualization, to name a few.  It is widely used by both private companies and academics. 

Importantly, the Python community is very helpful and resources exist for just about anything you want to know about Python. It seems there are unlimited possibilities to what you can do with it.  

This is a place where I build, experiment with and discuss digital creations made with Python, focusing on data analysis, geographic information systems, drones, and severe weather, specifically tornadoes.
